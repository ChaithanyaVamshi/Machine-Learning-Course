# Machine Learning Course

Semester1 2020

This repository consists of course material for CMP7228, Machine Learning. Each week's material can be found under the related folder number.

This is the first version for the course so the materials are constantly being updated. Please make sure you stay up to date. One way would be to frequently download the latest version by clicking on the "clone or download" button above. Optionally, you can also install git on your laptop and update it with git pull as semester progresses.
